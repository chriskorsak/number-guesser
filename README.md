This number guesser application is a project from [Modern Javascript From The Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning) on Udemy. It incorporates javascript DOM manipulation to support the game logic in a simple and clear manner.

Additionally, this application uses a CSS boilerplate framework called [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) to create the user interface. This application is fully responsive to all screen sizes.
